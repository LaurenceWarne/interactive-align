  #+END_SRC
  You can also bind it to different key (~(kbd "your-key")~).
* Commands
** ~(ialign-interactive-align BEG END)~
   Interactively align region /BEG/ /END/ using regexp read from minibuffer.

   As characters are typed in the minibuffer, the region is aligned
   using ~align-regexp~ and the result is presented to the user.

   In the minibuffer, ~ialign-minibuffer-keymap~ is the active keymap.
** ~(ialign-toggle-repeat)~
   Toggle /repeat/ argument passed to ~align-regexp~.

   When the repeat argument is non-nil, the alignment is repeated throughout
   the line.
** ~(ialign-toggle-tabs)~
   Toggle tab usage during alignment.
** ~(ialign-set-group GROUP)~
   Set the parenthesis group argument for the ~align-regexp~ command to /GROUP/.

   This should be called with a numeric prefix argument that is
   the group number to set.
** ~(ialign-increment-group)~, ~(ialign-decrement-group)~
   Increment/decrement the parenthesis group argument passed to ~align-regexp~.
** ~(ialign-set-spacing SPACING)~
   Set the spacing parameter passed to ~align-regexp~ command to /SPACING/.

   This should be called with a numeric prefix argument.
** ~(ialign-increment-spacing)~, ~(ialign-decrement-spacing)~
   Increment/decrement the amount of spacing passed to ~align-regexp~ command.
** ~(ialign-commit)~
   Align the region using the current regexp and commit change in the buffer.

   The region is aligned using the current regexp only if it's valid.
   Next alignments will use the newly aligned region.

* Options
** ~ialign-minibuffer-keymap~
   Keymap used in the minibuffer when ~ialign-interactive-align~ command is executed.
